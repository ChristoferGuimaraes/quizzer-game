# Quizzer - A simple quiz game

A simple Quiz Game that was developed while I was studying and learning Frontend Development with ReacJS.

## Usage

- You can select the number of `Questions`, `Difficulty` and `Category`.</br>
  The number of `Questions` is the only required one</br>
  If you don't choose the difficulty and category, they will be **RANDOM**. </br>And if you press the `Reset` button, that will **RESET** all the fields.
  </br></br>

  </br></br>

- After the `API request`, you will be able to select only one `answer` per `question` that will show to you if you are `right` or `wrong`, in case you are **WRONG**, it will show in green, the `CORRECT ANSWER`.
